Don't worry about what anybody else is going to do. The best way to
predict the future is to invent it.

Premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it)
in programming.

Lisp has jokingly been called "the most intelligent way to misuse a
computer". I think that description is a great compliment because it
transmits the full flavor of liberation: it has assisted a number of our
most gifted fellow humans in thinking previously impossible thoughts.

Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people

What Paul does, and does very well, is to take ideas and concepts that
are beautiful in the abstract, and brings them down to a real world
level. That's a rare talent to find in writing these days.

Since programmers create programs out of nothing, imagination is our
only limitation. Thus, in the world of programming, the hero is the one
who has great vision. Paul Graham is one of our contemporary heroes. He
has the ability to embrace the vision, and to express it plainly. His
works are my favorites, especially the ones describing language design.
He explains secrets of programming, languages, and human nature that can
only be learned from the hacker experience. This book shows you his
great vision, and tells you the truth about the nature of hacking.
-- Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto, creator of Ruby

To follow the path:
    look to the master,

You think you know when you learn, are more sure when you can write,
even more when you can teach, but certain when you can program.

Adapting old programs to fit new machines usually means adapting new
machines to behave like old ones.
